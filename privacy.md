Privacy Policy
==============

We do not want your data. SpaceSuit does not collect any data, or send any data
to us. The only time we will keep any data about you is if you make contact with
us, for example by emailing us, raising an issue on GitHub, or messaging us on
social media.

However, you should be aware that using SpaceSuit may give others valuable
information about you:

- SpaceSuit doesn't talk to the blockchain directly, but has to go through an
  Ethereum node. We don't run any Ethereum nodes, so by default SpaceSuit uses
  nodes provided by Infura.io. You can also choose from a number of alternative
  providers (we've listed their privacy policies below, where we could find
  them), or choose to use a node that you run yourself. These providers don't
  have access to your money, and don't have the ability to impersonate you,
  but will be able to see what dapps you use, and what you do with them.
- Whenever you make a transaction, it will be broadcast to the world, and will
  very quickly reach a very large number of people. This is part of how
  Ethereum works, and is designed to ensure that transactions are processed
  quickly. Once a transaction has been broadcast, it is almost impossible to
  delete it. Once a transaction has been accepted into the blockchain, it is
  completely impossible to delete it, and it is publicly visible to everyone.
- If you installed SpaceSuit from the Chrome Web Store, then Google will know
  about this. Google's privacy policy is listed below.
- SpaceSuit may make it easier for web sites you visit to track you, or to link
  information they hold about you to your actions and transactions on the
  blockchain.
